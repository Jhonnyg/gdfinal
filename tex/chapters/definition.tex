Name: User-driven Time manipulation


Time manipulation is a design concept that covers a strict selection of several game mechanics and patterns. 

This concept is itself not a specific set of rules a developer instantiates in order to achieve this game play style, but rather as an activity in which time is perceived as a game element that the user can interact with. The word interaction is a the key to this idea, it does not cover any part of a game's story(character x travels through time to kill character y), it's settings (alternate reality,historical locations etc.), the life and death of a character (games where characters have multiple lives, since dying and then placing this caracter in a predetermined location could be seen as time-travel). With this in mind, the concept 

% time itself is being manipulated, 

% alternate reality

The core idea of user driven time manipulation is that 

The term user-driven is in direct relation to the feedback loop generated between the player and the environment (game state). In most games, most of the player-environment interaction is being held inside of the environment itself. The player, manifested by an agent (avatar), multiple agents or other various elements in the game world, does not engage with the environment itself, but acts merely as input to the game.
