The idea of this concept is to drive a game's style of play by changing the timeline, which brings a new dimension of possibilites in terms of game mechanics, concepts and ideas to the table. Listed below is a collection of patterns and abstract mechanics that can be identified from games that fit the definition stated in section 1.1. These are abstract ideas that are not coupled together with a specific set of rules or restrictions, and can be interpreted quite freely with the only condition being that they are be user-directed and involves manipulating time. 

%. Rather, they are a showcase of different ways to incorporate time manipulation by implying that it must be specifed that something %happens when time is changed, and not what these changes may be. The environment stipulates the effects of this manipulation, as %stated by its set of rules. 

\begin{itemize}
\item{Time Travel} \\ Time travel is the largest category of time manipulation, and includes several important features, 
such as the cause-effect relationship and alternate realities. When including this category, it must be clear that the 
time manipulation is strictly user-driven. The time manipulation in a game such as Assassin's Creed is only related to the historic setting and its story, and not as a consequence of user-directed interaction. 

\item{Time Paradox} \\ The idea of time paradox is also related to causality, by moving in time, 
your actions will propagate to present time, enabling you to perform actions not possible with the initial conditions. 
Consider a game based on time manipulation where, in order to .. [example] 
your present self will have to [do something]. In "The misfortune events of P.B Winterbottom", the time paradox and alternate reality 
patterns is manifested by the main character co-existing in real-time with present versions of himself in order to solve certain tasks.

Examples of games with this mechanic: Chronotron, The Misadventures of P.B Winterbottom

\item{Bullet-Time} \\ Also called "slow motion" is a time manipulating feature that simply allows the player to slow 
down the notion of time in the game, however still linearily forwards in time and not in reverse. 
This change can affect either every element or a subset (e.g. the player only, everything but the player or something else) of the the environment. 
Examples of games with this mechanic: Max Payne, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and F.E.A.R

\item{Time Stopping} \\ Time Stopping is the mechanic that when used, stops time completely, providing negative or most commonly, positive side-effects. 
Examples of games with this mechanic: Prince of persia series, Megaman 2
